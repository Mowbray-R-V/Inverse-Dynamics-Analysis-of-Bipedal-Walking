Many spinal cord injury and stroke patients lose their ability to walk. Exoskeletons
are wearable devices that help them in regaining this ability by applying moments
corresponding to normal walking at their joints. This warrants an inverse dynamics
analysis for normal and healthy walking, in order to estimate these joint moments.
Such an analysis typically requires kinematic data and data about the ground
reaction forces (GRF). Thus in this project, various inverse dynamics models have
been investigated, in both 2D and 3D, and joint moments have been computed.
We initially look at models where the GRF is known, and then address the sit-
uation when data about the GRF might be unavailable. For this, we present a
novel formulation in which the GRF is estimated from a 2D whole body lagrangian
analysis and the zero-moment point (ZMP) concept. We also try to estimate the
GRF by utilizing the ZMP concept for a 3D whole body analysis. Once the joint
moments have been computed, the motors of the exoskeleton can then apply these
values of moments to correct the gait of a patient.
